# Lab 01 - Input Output Review

## Lab Goal
This lab was designed to give you practice using the **Scanner** class to read input from the keyboard, store the input as variables, then write messages to the console based on the input.

## Instructions
1. Modify the link at the top of your **Readme.md** to reflect your username.
2. Edit the main() method in **Input.java** to do the following:
    * Instantiate a Scanner variable
    * Ask the user for their name and store the result as a string.
    * Ask the user for their age and store the result as an int.
    * Ask the user for the year of their most recent birthday and store the result as an int.
    * Calculate the year they were born.
    * Output the message "Name was born in xxxx"

## Notes
* Checkstyle config link is http://www.daveavis.com/cs/checkstyle_SHS.xml
* After cloning your repo from GitHub you can open your code in BlueJ by double clicking on the **package** file.

## Grading
* 30 - Correctly received input.
* 30 - Correctly stored input as variables.
* 30 - Correct output.
* 10 - style

Note that these are potential maximums; the computer can only check so much.  If your code passes checkstyle, but I see non-descriptive variable names, then your style grade will go down.  If your code passes all tests, but I see code that was copied off of the internet or from another student your grade will go *way* down.
